# CodonBias_QualityControl
This code includes all the code and data to generate the figures in the paper entitled: "Poor codon optimality as a signal to degrade transcripts with frameshift"

Random_transcription.py is a code to simulate the tAI of random ORFs of the yeast genome.
generate_Transcript_errors.py is for simulating the impact of errors on tAI and 3'UTR length.
CodonBias_QC_Functions_and_classes.py are the functions used in the other scripts
